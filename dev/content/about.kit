        <p id="paragraph1">Salvation Mountain is a literal man-made mountain built by late artist Leonard Knight. The surreal attraction is 28 years in the making and covered in half a million gallons of latex paint. What started as a small monument made of dirt and painted cement became, over time, a sprawling adobe and hay-bale mountain complex, with peripheral structures made of telephone  poles, tires, and car windows, as  well as art cars and sculptures, all painted in a patchwork of stripes  and color blocks of whatever paint was donated that week.</p>

        <p id="paragraph2">After arriving in Niland, California, Leonard made several failed attempts to spread his message of love with a hot air balloon. Accepting defeat, he decided he would leave town, but first he would create a small statement. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months. Each day, Leonard would put a little more cement and a little more paint on the side of a forgotten riverbank.

        As his monument grew taller and taller, he would pack old junk he found at the dump onto the side of his "mountain," fill it with sand and cover it with cement and paint.
